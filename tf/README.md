# EdgeML: Tensorflow Implementations 

This directory includes, Tensorflow implementations of various techniques and
algorithms developed as part of EdgeML. Currently, the following algorithms are
available in Tensorflow:

1. [Bonsai](../docs/publications/Bonsai.pdf)
2. [EMI-RNN](../docs/publications/EMI-RNN.pdf)
3. [Fast(G)RNN](../docs/publications/FastGRNN.pdf)
4. [ProtoNN](../docs/publications/ProtoNN.pdf)

Usage directions and examples of all of the above algorithms are provided in
`examples` subdirectory. 

**TODO**: TF library requirements.
